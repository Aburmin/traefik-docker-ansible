# Ansible : Multiple Websites with Traefik and Docker

This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) playbook to install multiple Websites on a single Ubuntu server with [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Traefik](https://traefik.io) updated with [Watchtower](https://github.com/v2tec/watchtower).

## Requirements

+ Ansible >= 2.4.0.0

## Applications

This playbook is designed to install a bunch of useful tools :

+ Curl
+ Docker
+ Docker-compose
+ Git
+ htop
+ ntp
+ tmux
+ Traefik
+ Vim
+ ZSH + Oh My Zsh with "ys" theme

## Installing on production

Copy the hosts example file and change the values to your needs :

```bash
$ cp hosts.example hosts
```

Setup your variables in the ```playbook.yml``` file.

Then run the playbook :

```bash
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml
```

## Installing on virtual machine

You can also test this Playbook on a virtual machine for some tests.

Before starting, you need to install :

+ [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
+ [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org)

Then run :

```bash
$ vagrant up
```

The default IP address is ```192.168.50.4```. You need to setup your ```hosts``` and ```~/.ssh/config``` files to give an SSH access to Ansible into your virtual machine.
