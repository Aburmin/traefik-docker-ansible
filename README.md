# My Ansible Playbook

This is my Ansible Playbook to fit with Ubuntu Xenial (16.04 LTS) servers.

## Requirements

+ Ansible >= 2.4.0.0

## Applications

This playbook is designed to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and a bunch of useful tools :

+ Docker
+ Docker-compose
+ Vim
+ Git
+ htop
+ Curl

## Installing on production

Setup your servers addresses in the ```hosts``` file, then run the playbook :

```bash
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml
```

## Installing on virtual machine

You can also test this Playbook on a virtual machine for some tests.

Before starting, you need to install :

+ [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
+ [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org)

Then run :

```bash
$ vagrant up
```

The default IP address is ```192.168.50.4```. You need to setup your ```hosts``` and ```~/.ssh/config``` files to give an SSH access to Ansible into your virtual machine.
